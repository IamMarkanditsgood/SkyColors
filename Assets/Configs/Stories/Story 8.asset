  _title: The Lighthouse in the Sky
  _description: "Far out at sea, there was a lonely island with a tiny airstrip and
    a single lighthouse. Its light rarely reached the mainland \u2014 but for pilots
    crossing the endless ocean, it was a beacon of hope. Captain Rosa was on her
    longest solo flight, carrying important supplies to a distant archipelago. Night
    was falling fast, and clouds thickened around her, hiding the stars. The radio
    crackled, then fell silent. Her map showed nothing but water for miles \u2014
    and her fuel was running low. Through the heavy mist, she caught a glimpse of
    something \u2014 not a star, not lightning, but a steady, pulsing light. It was
    the island lighthouse, piercing the fog like a heartbeat. Guided by that small,
    stubborn light, Rosa descended and landed safely. As she stepped onto solid ground,
    she looked up at the lighthouse and whispered, \"Thank you.\" Sometimes, she
    thought, even the smallest light can save the biggest dreams. "
