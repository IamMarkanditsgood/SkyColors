  _title: The Lost Compass
  _description: "In the wide desert, where sand stretched beyond the horizon, navigation
    wasn't easy. Pilots relied on maps, instincts \u2014 and sometimes, a little
    luck. Maya was delivering supplies across the dunes when a fierce sandstorm swallowed
    the sky. Visibility dropped to almost nothing. In the chaos, her old compass
    \u2014 the one her grandfather had given her \u2014 snapped off its mount and
    disappeared somewhere in the cockpit. For a moment, fear gripped her. Alone,
    lost, and with no clear direction. But then Maya remembered her grandfather's
    words: \"Sometimes, you don't need a compass. Sometimes, you follow the sky you
    trust.\" She took a deep breath, steadied the plane, and focused on the shape
    of the dunes below, the color of the light, the feel of the wind. Hours later,
    tired but determined, she spotted the landing strip \u2014 a small dark line
    in a sea of gold. When she touched down, she laughed \u2014 a wild, relieved
    laugh \u2014 and decided to leave the broken compass just where it had fallen.
    Because some journeys, she realized, are meant to be guided by the heart."
