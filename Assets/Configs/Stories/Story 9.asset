  _title: The Sky Belongs to Everyone
  _description: "In a dusty village surrounded by golden hills, children would gather
    at the edge of the fields, pointing excitedly whenever a plane crossed the sky.
    For them, the sky was magic \u2014 something unreachable, reserved for heroes
    and explorers. One summer day, a pilot named Javier landed his small plane on
    the old dirt strip near the village. He wasn't famous. He had no medals. But
    he had something better: time. He opened the cockpit, waved the children over,
    and one by one, lifted them inside to sit behind the controls. They touched the
    levers, the dials, the worn leather seat \u2014 all wide-eyed with wonder. Before
    leaving, Javier painted a simple message on the side of his plane, just above
    the wing: \"The sky belongs to everyone.\" When he soared back into the clouds,
    dozens of small hands waved after him, and the village airstrip wasn't just a
    patch of dirt anymore \u2014 it had become a launchpad for dreams. "
