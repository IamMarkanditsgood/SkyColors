  _title: The Music of the Sky
  _description: "In a small town by the cliffs, there was an old belief: if you flew
    above the ocean at sunrise, you could hear the sky sing. Theo, a young pilot
    with a beat-up yellow plane, always laughed at the legend. But one morning, curious
    and restless, he decided to find out for himself. He took off just before dawn.
    The sea below was a dark mirror, the cliffs a sleeping giant. As the first rays
    of sunlight broke across the water, the wind shifted \u2014 and Theo heard it:
    a soft, rising hum, like a distant choir. It wasn't a song you could catch or
    record. It was the music of the air, the water, the light \u2014 something that
    could only be heard once you truly listened. Theo smiled, soaring higher into
    the golden morning, realizing that some melodies were meant only for those brave
    enough to chase them. "
