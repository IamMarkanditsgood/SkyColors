  _title: The Storm and the Star
  _description: "Captain Elias had flown through all kinds of skies \u2014 clear
    blue mornings, heavy winter snows, golden autumn sunsets. But tonight, the sky
    was wild. A fierce storm rolled across the mountains, tossing the small cargo
    plane like a leaf in the wind. As lightning streaked the heavens, Elias tightened
    his grip on the controls. Somewhere beyond the darkness, a remote village was
    waiting for the supplies he carried \u2014 food, medicine, and hope. For a moment,
    the turbulence grew so strong that the stars above disappeared behind thick black
    clouds. Elias closed his eyes for just a second and whispered to the night: \"Just
    give me one star to follow.\" When he opened his eyes, a single bright star pierced
    through the storm, shining above the horizon. Guided by its light, the plane
    broke through the clouds, gliding safely toward the village. Later, as Elias
    stood on the ground, watching grateful villagers unload the supplies, he looked
    back at the sky and smiled. Sometimes, he thought, even the fiercest storms leave
    a path for those who dare to keep flying. "
