  _title: Wings of Paper
  _description: "When Noah was six years old, he dreamed of flying higher than the
    clouds. But in his small village, airplanes were a rare sight, only appearing
    as tiny silver specks in the sky. Every afternoon, Noah would sit by the fields,
    folding colorful paper into little airplanes. Some were bright red, others deep
    blue, each one carrying a secret wish scribbled inside the folds. He would launch
    them into the wind, laughing as they danced and spiraled towards the sky. One
    day, as Noah released a golden paper plane, a real airplane rumbled overhead
    \u2014 a rescue pilot delivering supplies after a distant storm. The pilot, noticing
    the flicker of gold, dipped his wings in greeting. To Noah, it felt like the
    sky itself had answered his call. Years later, Noah became a pilot too. And in
    his cockpit, tucked into the dashboard, he kept a tiny golden paper plane \u2014
    a reminder that even the smallest dreams can one day touch the clouds. "
