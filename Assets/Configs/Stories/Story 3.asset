  _title: The Silent Goodbye
  _description: "In a small coastal town, the airfield had only one runway and one
    old hangar. It wasn\u2019t a place for grand takeoffs \u2014 only quiet arrivals
    and heartfelt departures. Mr. Bennett, the town\u2019s mechanic, spent his days
    repairing planes that carried families, supplies, and sometimes dreams. He was
    known for his skill \u2014 but even more for his silence. No one ever heard him
    boast or complain. He simply worked, smiled, and tightened every bolt with the
    same care. One autumn evening, the community gathered for a farewell. A young
    pilot, Emma, was leaving for her first long-distance journey across the sea \u2014
    a dream she had chased since childhood. As she boarded her plane, she spotted
    Mr. Bennett standing by the hangar, hands in his pockets, watching. He didn\u2019t
    wave, and he didn\u2019t shout. But when Emma looked closer, she saw that he
    had painted a small symbol on the side of her plane \u2014 a simple golden feather,
    shining in the setting sun. It was his way of saying, \"Fly safe. Carry our hopes
    with you.\" Emma smiled, touched the feather gently, and soared into the sky,
    carrying her town\u2019s silent goodbye with her."
