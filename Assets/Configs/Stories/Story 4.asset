  _title: The First Flight
  _description: "Lina always dreamed of flying. As a child, she built wings out of
    cardboard and raced through the fields, imagining the clouds swirling around
    her. Years later, standing on the edge of a small runway, she faced her real
    dream: her very first solo flight. The little training plane in front of her
    wasn\u2019t large or powerful \u2014 but to her, it was the most magnificent
    machine in the world. Her instructor patted the side of the plane and simply
    said, \"Trust the sky.\" No long speeches. No instructions. Just faith. As Lina
    pulled back on the controls, the ground began to fall away. The rooftops, the
    trees, the roads \u2014 all shrinking, while the sky grew wide and endless before
    her. She laughed, a sound carried away by the rushing wind. She wasn\u2019t pretending
    anymore. She was flying. Up there, with the golden horizon stretching forever,
    Lina realized: it\u2019s not just machines that lift people into the sky. It\u2019s
    dreams. It\u2019s courage."
